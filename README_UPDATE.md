# Update Notes

- **about.md** and **about.html** contain the full About page copy and markup.
- **HomeHeirloomBlock.html** holds the reusable homepage hero and four-pillar block. It is included in `index.html`.
- **waitlist.html** provides a placeholder page for the waitlist signup.
- To edit these sections, modify the corresponding files directly; the site has no build step.
