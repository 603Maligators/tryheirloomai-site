    <h1>Heirloom â€” The Family Memory OS</h1>
    <p class="tagline"><em>A private archive of voices, stories, and moments â€” preserved for generations.</em></p>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Families lose voices, videos, and stories as years pass. Personal histories are scattered across devices, lost to platform lockâ€‘in, or forgotten as technology evolves. Existing tools are fragmented and rarely privacyâ€‘first.</p>
      <p>The result is the gradual erosion of family identity and legacy. Without a trusted archive, memories disappear when hardware fails or accounts expire.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Heirloom unifies journaling, voice, and video capture into a single secure platform. AI recall transforms raw entries into meaningful stories, timelines, and insights while keeping families in full control of their data.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Effortless capture:</strong> record text, voice, and video from any device.</li>
        <li><strong>Generative recall:</strong> AI organizes entries into searchable timelines and narrative highlights.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacyâ€‘first architecture:</strong> endâ€‘toâ€‘end encryption and local export options keep ownership with the family.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Product Roadmap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MVP (Year 1):</strong> Seamless daily journaling and voice capture with search and playback.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Ingestion of past photos, videos, and notes; AIâ€‘crafted multiâ€‘chapter life stories.</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Genealogy mode to connect family relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Future:</strong> Dedicated hardware units for local, offline custody and ultraâ€‘longâ€‘term storage.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
      <p>The global personal journaling and genealogy markets exceed $5B annually and continue to grow. Consumer demand for AIâ€‘assisted memory tools is accelerating as digital storytelling and family history preservation become mainstream.</p>
      <p>Heirloom sits at the intersection of emotion, technology, and privacyâ€”a defensible and expanding market with limited competition for secure, familyâ€‘oriented archives.</p>

    <section>

        <li>Multiâ€‘user family packs to drive adoption across households.</li>
        <li>Limited lifetime license options for early supporters.</li>
        <li>Future revenue from premium hardware appliances.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Closing Vision</h2>
      <p>Heirloom is more than softwareâ€”it is a generational archive designed to outlive its creators. By combining privacyâ€‘first technology with humanâ€‘centered storytelling, Heirloom ensures that families preserve their history, voices, and values for decades to come.</p>
