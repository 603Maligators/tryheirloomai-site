      <h1>About Heirloom</h1>
      <h2>Capture today. Preserve for tomorrow. Live on forever.</h2>
      <p>Heirloom helps you record the moments of your life—your words, your voice, your videos—and keep them safe for the people who matter most. Private by default. Built for decades, not trends.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Why we’re building Heirloom</h2>
      <p>Memories don’t disappear all at once—they slip away in small details: the sound of a laugh, the way someone told a story, the look in a moment you didn’t think to save.</p>
      <p>Heirloom began as a promise: to build a durable, private place for those details. Not a feed. Not a trend. A living archive of your life—something you can return to and something your family can hold on to, even after you’re gone.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>How Heirloom works</h2>
      <p>We’ve designed Heirloom around four pillars:</p>
      <h3>1. Capture</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Journaling</strong> – Write daily entries with timestamps.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice Notes</strong> – Record your voice; we transcribe and save both text and audio.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Uploads</strong> – Add personal videos alongside your stories.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Prompts</strong> – Gentle nudges to help capture moments you might otherwise miss.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2. Preserve</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Private by Default</strong> – You control who sees what.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean Timeline</strong> – Watch your days stack into a clear record of your life.</li>
        <li><strong>Export &amp; Backup</strong> – Practical options so your data is never trapped.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. Recall</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Searchable Memories</strong> – Find entries by date, keyword, or mood.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Powered Recall (coming soon)</strong> – Ask in plain language: <em>“What did Dad sound like when I was 10?”</em> or <em>“Show me every video from our first house.”</em></li>
        <li><strong>Life Story Chapters</strong> – With enough entries, Heirloom weaves your memories into multi-chapter narratives—your life told back to you like a book.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>4. Legacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Talk to Me</strong> – Over years, Heirloom learns your voice and your personality. Long after you’re gone, your loved ones can ask you questions, carry on conversations, or hear you read your grandchildren a bedtime story in your own voice.</li>
        <li><strong>Genealogy Mode</strong> – Connect family trees so your memories link with the generations before and after you.</li>
        <li><strong>Posthumous Release</strong> – Share messages, videos, or life chapters on your terms, even after death.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Privacy first. Longevity always.</h2>
      <p>Your data is your story. We build Heirloom with four core principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Privacy-first design</strong> – You decide what’s shared and what stays private.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad model transparency</strong> – Free tier includes ads, including targeted ads; premium tiers are ad-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Export-ready</strong> – Your data can always be backed up or moved.</li>
        <li><strong>Longevity-focused</strong> – Optimized for decades, not product cycles.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>What’s next</h2>
      <p>We’re building toward the first release focused on journaling, voice capture, and video uploads within the next 12 months. From there, we’ll carefully expand features, guided by privacy and durability.</p>
      <p>Check the public roadmap to follow our progress.</p>

      <h2>The person behind Heirloom</h2>
      <p>Heirloom isn’t the work of a big team. It began with one founder—me—driven by the need to keep family voices and stories alive before they were lost.</p>
      <p>Right now, I’m designing, coding, and testing every part of it myself. But Heirloom isn’t meant to stay a solo effort. I’m open to partners and contributors who share the belief that our lives deserve to be remembered across generations.</p>
      <p>This project is personal—but it’s built to become something bigger than me.</p>
