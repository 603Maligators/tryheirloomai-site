    <h1>About Heirloom</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>The Spark</h2>
      <p>Heirloom began with a simple, stubborn question: why do our best memories live in a thousand places and still slip away? Phones get replaced, platforms change, and family stories scatter. We built Heirloom to pull the threads together‚Äîyour photos, videos, notes, voice logs, little moments‚Äîand weave them into something that lasts.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>What Heirloom Does Today</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Capture the everyday: quick journals, voice notes, photos, and milestones that slot right into a private timeline.</li>
        <li>Ingest the past: pull in old albums and files, keep originals organized, and de-duplicate safely.</li>
        <li>Recall with context: find moments by people, places, dates, or even vibes‚Äî‚Äúthat rainy day in June with the dogs.‚Äù</li>
        <li>Tell the story: draft multi-chapter life stories from your timeline, with citations back to your own memories.</li>
        <li>Share, selectively: invite family into specific albums or chapters‚Äîprivate by default, on your terms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What‚Äôs Next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Genealogy mode: understand relationships across generations, blending family trees with real memories.</li>
        <li>Talk to Me: ask natural questions about your life (‚ÄúWhen did we visit Acadia?‚Äù), and get answers grounded in your data.</li>
        <li>Posthumous releases: schedule messages or chapters to be shared later, with proper controls and consent.</li>
        <li>Deeper search: richer queries across emotions, locations, and recurring rituals.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>The Long View</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Local-first hardware: a dedicated HeirloomOS device for full offline operation, GPU-powered recall, and long-term archival at home.</li>
        <li>Seamless migration: start in the web app, move to hardware when you‚Äôre ready‚Äîsame account, same memories, no lock-in.</li>
        <li>Privacy as a principle: client-side encryption options, no ad targeting, no data resale. Your stories stay yours.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Memories are more than files; they‚Äôre the connective tissue of a family. Heirloom‚Äôs job is to protect them, organize them, and help them speak.</p>
