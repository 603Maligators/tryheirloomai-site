      <h1>About Heirloom</h1>
      <p class="lede">Build a living archive of your lifeâ€”one entry, one voice note at a time.</p>
      <p>Heirloom helps you capture daily thoughts, speak your memories out loud, and keep them safe for the people who matter. Private by default. Built for decades.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section" id="story">
      <h2>Why weâ€™re building Heirloom</h2>
      <p>Some memories vanish in tiny waysâ€”the sound of a laugh, the way someone told a story. Heirloom began as a promise to hold on to those details before they fade. Weâ€™re building a simple, durable place to put your days: words youâ€™ve written, thoughts youâ€™ve spoken, moments you donâ€™t want to lose. Not a feed. Not a trend. A home for what matters across a lifetime.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section" id="what-is">
      <h2>What is Heirloom?</h2>
      <p>Heirloom is a private, long-term memory home. Start with journaling and voice notes.</p>
      <p>Over time, your entries stack into a clear, searchable record of your lifeâ€”something you can return to, share selectively, and preserve.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section" id="focus">
      <h2>What weâ€™re building first</h2>
      <p>In our first year, weâ€™re focused on doing a few things exceptionally well:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Journaling: Write daily entries with timestamps.</li>
        <li>Voice capture: Record voice notes; automatic transcription.</li>
        <li>Private by default: Your data stays yours.</li>
        <li>Clean timeline: See your days stack into a life.</li>
        <li>Export-ready foundation: Laying groundwork for local backups.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are the core stones of our first year.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section" id="how">
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>Sign in and youâ€™re on your timeline. Write a journal entry or tap record to speak a thought out loud.</p>
      <p>We transcribe your voice note and keep the audio. Entries are organized by day so you can skim your timeline. Early search lets you pull up moments by date or keyword.</p>
      <p>As we iterate, search and export options will expandâ€”carefully, with privacy as the guiding rule.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section" id="privacy">
      <h2>Privacy first. Your stories, your rules.</h2>
      <p>Your data is your story. Weâ€™re building Heirloom with a privacy-first mindset: no ad targeting, transparent processing, and practical export options so youâ€™re never trapped.</p>
      <p>Longevity matters; weâ€™re optimizing for decades, not quarters. Local-first foundations guide our future so your memories remain under your control.</p>
